* **Future Directions and Challenges (35 Minutes)**
    * Hyperbolic pre-trained models
    * Advanced hyperbolic foundation models
    * Hyperbolic deep learning tools and libraries
    * Open problems and research opportunities
    

### Interactive Components
- **Live Polling:** Using tools like Slido or Mentimeter for real-time audience engagement.
- **Open-ended Discussions:** Facilitated discussions on key challenges and future directions.
- **Interactive Q&A:** Dedicated sessions for audience questions, using platforms like Google Moderator.

### Societal Impact
Foundation models and hyperbolic deep learning have broad societal applications, including:
- Natural language processing (hierarchical concept capture, privacy-preserving representations, summarization)
- Computer vision (object detection, segmentation, video prediction)
- Natural sciences (protein folding, single-cell analysis, brain modeling)
- Complex networks (social networks, recommender systems)

This tutorial will support future research in hyperbolic foundation models, which have the potential to advance these important areas for wide societal impact.

## Target Audience and Prerequisite

This tutorial targets machine learning researchers of any background, particularly those interested in foundation models, non-Euclidean, and geometric deep learning. We explore advanced applications of hyperbolic geometry in these fields, focusing on large-scale hyperbolic models that extend beyond the concepts covered in previous tutorials. No special background in differential geometry is required, though familiarity with mathematical concepts such as Riemannian manifolds would be helpful. The tutorial is accessible to researchers and practitioners from diverse backgrounds, including those with limited prior exposure to hyperbolic geometry or geometric deep learning.
