# Call for Papers: Personalization in the Era of Large Foundation Models @ AAAI 2026

The Personalization in the Era of Large Foundation Models (PerFM) Workshop will take place at [AAAI 2026](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2026) in Sinapore, from January 20-27, 2026.


## Goal of Our Topics


While foundation models excel across NLP, computer vision, and multimodal tasks, they cannot capture individual user characteristics—preferences, behavioral patterns, and contextual needs—creating a disconnect between general intelligence and personalized user experience. This workshop "Personalization in the Era of Large Foundation Models (PerFM 2026)" will unite researchers and practitioners to explore theoretical foundations, scalable architectures, evaluation methods, lifelong learning, and ethical considerations, shaping the next generation of AI systems that adapt to and grow with individual users.


## Topics and Scope

We welcome submissions on topics related to the intersection of foundation models and human-centered AI, covering topics include, but are not limited to:

### Theoretical Foundations
- Generalization error, representation precision, curvature-dimension tradeoffs
- Geometric properties (curvature, geodesics, isometries)
- Expressive power of non-Euclidean representations

### Evaluation and Benchmarks 
- Adapting existing foundation models to non-Euclidean spaces
- Developing new foundation models for non-Euclidean operations
- Investigating non-Euclidean architectures in conjunction with foundation models

### Personalization Architectures
- Graph analysis, text processing, image understanding
- Biomedical research and AI for scientific discovery
- Drug discovery, material science, climate modeling

### Efficient and Scalable Systems
- Adversarial robustness, fairness, interpretability
- Privacy in non-Euclidean foundation models

### Memory and Lifelong Learning
- New datasets and evaluation protocols
- Software libraries supporting the integration of foundation models and non-Euclidean representations

### Privacy, Ethical, and Social Considerations

### Cross-Domain Applications

## Submission Guidelines
