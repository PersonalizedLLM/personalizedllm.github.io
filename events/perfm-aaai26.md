# PerFM: Personalized Foundation Models Workshop @ AAAI 2026

## — Personalization for Foundation Models

The PerFM Workshop will be held at AAAI 2026. We invite the community to discuss personalized learning paradigms for foundation models, including theory, methods, systems, and applications.

PerFM Workshop @ AAAI 2026, Location TBA, Date TBA.

## News

- 2026-XX-XX: Website launched.
- 2026-XX-XX: Call for Contributions released.

## 1. Workshop Introduction

Personalized learning with foundation models aims to adapt large models to individual users, tasks, organizations, and dynamic contexts while preserving privacy, robustness, and efficiency. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners to explore personalization across modalities and domains, from personalized LLMs and vision-language models to time series and recommender systems.

## 2. Call for Contributions (Topics and Scope)

We welcome submissions on topics including but not limited to:

- **Theoretical Foundations**: Generalization and stability under personalization, user heterogeneity, multi-task and meta-learning theory, privacy–utility trade-offs.
- **Architectures and Algorithms**: Parameter-efficient tuning, preference alignment, retrieval-augmented personalization, federated and decentralized personalization, on-device adaptation.
- **Applications**: Dialogue systems, recommendation, healthcare, education, finance, scientific discovery, time-series forecasting.
- **Trustworthiness**: Safety, robustness, fairness, privacy-preserving personalization, evaluation protocols for personalized FM.
- **Benchmarks and Tooling**: Datasets, metrics, simulators, open-source libraries for personalized FM.

## 3. Submissions and Timeline

Submissions should be PDFs of ≤ 9 pages (excluding references and appendices). Double-blind review. We welcome original work, recently published work, and work-in-progress. By default, submissions are non-archival.
